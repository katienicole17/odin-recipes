<li>tortilla wraps </li>
<li>onion</li>
<li>peppers</li>
<li>garlic</li>
<li>lettuce</li>

<li>tomato puree (yes, the type you put on pizza)</li>
<li>frying pan</li>

</ul>

<h3> The step-by-step...</h3>
<ol>
    <li>First, roughly chop the onion, peppers and garlic. </li>
    <li>Heat the oil in a pan and add the onion, garlic and chicken as these take the longest to cook.
    <li>Whilst that is cooking, prepare the other fillings, chop the cucumber and lettuce into thin strips and grate the cheese.</li>
    <li>Once the onion and chicken are 2/3 cooked, add the pepper.</li>
    <li>Once the fillings have started to brown off, add the seasoning and tomato puree. Mix well.</li>
    <li>Heat the tortilla wraps in the microwave for 30 seconds (optional).</li>
    <li>Now, we can start to assemble the fajitas. Place the chicken and pepper mix in the middle of the wrap, add the lettuce, cucumber, cheese, salsa, guacamole and sour cream on top.</li>
    <li>Now, we are ready to roll! Roll the fajitas tightly, tucking in the sides to avoid them falling out and making sure to keep the fillings in place.</li>
    <li><strong>Serve and enjoy!</strong></li>
