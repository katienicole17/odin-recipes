    <h3> You will need: </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>250g sushi rice </li>
        <li>3 tbsp rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>4 sheets of sushi nori (typically slightly smaller than a piece of paper)</li>
        <li>1/3 of a cucumber</li>
        <li>1 avocado</li>
        <li>12 crab/seafood sticks</li>
        <li>Black sesame seeds <em>if wanted,</em> however these are not necessary</li>
        <li>Crispy onions, <em>eyeballed to your liking</em></li>
        <li>A sauce of your choice i.e siracha mayo, soy sauce etc</li>
        <li>A bamboo sushi mat</li>
        <li>A sharp knife</li>
        <li>cling film (plastic film) </li>
        <li>A saucepan with a lid </li>
        <li>Tap water </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> The step-by-step...</h3>
    <ol> 
        <li>First,we will need to wash the rice in a bowl. To do this, put water in the bowl, stir with your hand in a circular motion, drain the water and repeat. Repeat this until the water comes out clear. </li>
        <li>Once the rice is washed and drained for the final time, put it in a saucepan and add 330ml of cold water. Turn the stove onto a medium-high setting until it <strong> starts </strong>to boil.</li>
        <li>When you notice it starting to boil, turn the heat down low and put the lid on. Leave it on low for 10 minutes before turning the oven off. Leave the lid on for another 10 minutes after turning the oven off. </li>
        <li>While the rice is cooking, we can prepare the vinegar mixture. In a small bowl, mix the rice vinegar, sugar and salt together until the sugar and salt have dissolved. This may take a few minutes but we <strong> promise </strong>that it will eventually dissolve.</li>
        <li>Once the rice is <em>slightly </em>cooled but not cold, add the vinegar mixture. Stir the rice until the vinegar mixture is evenly distributed. </li>
        <li>Now, we can prepare the fillings. Cut the cucumber and avocado <strong>lengthwise </strong>into thin strips. </li>
        <li>Cut the sushi nori in half <strong>widthwise.</strong> Then, wrap the bamboo mat in cling film to avoid the rice sticking to the mat.</li>
        <li>Now, we can start to assemble the sushi. Place a nori on the mat and spread a thin layer of rice all over. Make sure it is squashed on to avoid rice falling off. </li>
        <li>Sprinkle the black sesame seeds on top of the rice. <strong>This step is optional. </strong></li>
        <li>Flip the nori over so the rice is facing down. Place 2 crabsticks, 2 or 3 avacado slices and some cucumber on the part closest to you. You can also add the sauce (not soy sauce) at this part if you want to avoid dipping. </li>
        <li>Now, we are ready to roll! Roll the sushi tightly, making sure to keep the fillings in place. </li>
        <li>Once rolled, shape the sushi again with the mat to avoid it coming loose. </li>
        <li>Now, we can cut the sushi. Use a wet, sharp knife. Some people cut it in half, then half again etc. However, i have found it easier to cut it <em>one by one. </em>Avoid putting pressure on the knife or sushi, just gently glide it through. </li>
        <li>Once cut, you can add the crispy onions on top. </li>
        <li><strong>Serve and enjoy!</strong></li>
