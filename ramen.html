    <p>Bored of the same old ramen day-in day-out?<em> We get you.</em> Lucky for you this dish will change your ramen from mid to momentous. From sus to succulent. From aldi to audi.   </p>


<h3> You will need: </h3> 
<p>The good thing about ramen is that it's whatever you want it to be, meaning if there's something <strong>you dont like</strong> in this recipe, you can simply switch it out for something you do.</p>
<ul>
<li>1 pack ramen noodles of your choice </li>
<li>1 spring onion</li>
<li>3 mushrooms</li>
<li>1 egg</li>
<li>1 stock cube</li>
<li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
<li>1 tbsp brown sugar</li>
<li>1/2 tbsp sesame oil</li>
<li>kimchi <em>to your liking</em></li>
<li>1 saucepan</li>
<li>1 sharp knife</li>
</ul>

<h3> The step-by-step...</h3>
<ol>
    <li>First, boil the kettle and pour the water into the saucepan. Add the stock cube and bring to the boil.</li>
    <li>Whilst the water is heating up, chop the spring onion and mushrooms into thin slices.</li>
    <li>Once the water has boiled, add the egg (still in the shell) and the mushrooms as these take the longest to cook.</li>
    <li>After 3 or 4 minutes, remove the egg and place it in a bowl of cold water so it's easier to peel.</li>
    <li>Now, add the ramen noodles and spring onion to the pan (with the mushrooms still in) and cook until soft.</li>
    <li>Whilst the noodles are cooking, peel the egg and cut it in half.</li>
    <li>Once the noodles are cooked, add the flavour packet that comes with the ramen, soy sauce, brown sugar and sesame oil. Mix well.</li>
    <li>Now, pour the noodles in a bowl, dont worry about excess water, as this has formed a soup base whilst cooking.</li>
    <li>Place the egg on top of the noodles and add the kimchi on the side.</li>
    <li>Serve with <stong>chopsticks/fork</stong> and a <strong>large spoon</strong> for the soup base. </li>
    <li><strong>Enjoy!</strong></li>
